# Task queue examples

- [example 1](./ex1.py): Shows simple basic task queue usage. Using `init_queue` interface handles defaulting.
- [example 2](./ex2.py): Introduce task policy, and per task override. And _sync_ execution by blocking until finish.
- [example 3](./ex3.py): Introducing process based executor. Run CPU-bound task on both thread and task based queues.
- [example 4](./ex4.py): dealing with tasks: get_result, stream_as_completed, wait_all()
- [example 5](./ex5.py): processes (to be implemented)
